Q7.  Whatâ€™s async & await Keyword in JavaScript


The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. The await keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('calling');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
  console.log(result);
  // Expected output: "resolved"
}

asyncCall();


Await is usually used to unwrap promises by passing a Promise as the expression. Using await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected). When execution resumes, the value of the await expression becomes that of the fulfilled promise. If the promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. The function containing the await expression will appear in the stack trace of the error. Otherwise, if the rejected promise is not awaited or is immediately returned, the caller function will not appear in the stack trace.

function resolveAfter2Seconds(x) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(x);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function f1() {
  const x = await resolveAfter2Seconds(10);
  console.log(x); // 10
}

f1();
