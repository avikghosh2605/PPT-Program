Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.


Absolute Positioning: When an element is set to "position: absolute," it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block if no ancestor is positioned.
Absolute positioning takes the element out of the normal document flow, allowing it to be placed anywhere on the page.
Example: Let's say we have an HTML structure with a parent container set to "position: relative," and inside it, we have a child element with "position: absolute." The child element's position will be determined by its top, bottom, left, and right property values in relation to its nearest positioned ancestor.
Relative Positioning: When an element is set to "position: relative," it is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
Relative positioning does not remove the element from the normal flow; it only shifts the element's position without affecting other elements' layout.
Example: Suppose we have a paragraph element with "position: relative." We can then use the top, bottom, left, and right properties to shift its position relative to its original position without affecting the surrounding elements.
Sticky Positioning: Sticky positioning is a hybrid between relative and fixed positioning.
When an element is set to "position: sticky," it remains in the normal flow until it reaches a specified threshold (usually a certain scroll position) and then behaves like "position: fixed" within its containing block.
Example: Consider a navigation bar with "position: sticky" and "top: 0." As the user scrolls down the page, the navigation bar will stick to the top of the viewport until it reaches a certain point, at which it will remain fixed even as the user continues scrolling.
Fixed Positioning: When an element is set to "position: fixed," it is positioned relative to the viewport and remains fixed in that position even when the page is scrolled.
Fixed positioning takes the element out of the normal flow and can be used for elements like headers, footers, or sidebars that need to remain in a fixed position.
Example: Suppose we have a button element with "position: fixed" and "bottom: 20px" and "right: 20px." This button will always remain in the same position, 20 pixels from the bottom and 20 pixels from the right of the viewport, regardless of scrolling.
