Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?


In computer programming, a constructor is a special method or function within a class that is responsible for initializing the objects of that class. It is called automatically when an object is created from the class. The purpose of a constructor is to ensure that the object being created starts with a valid and well-defined state.

Here are some key points about constructors:

Initialization: Constructors initialize the data members of an object to their initial values. It sets the initial state of the object and prepares it for use.

Same name as the class: Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to. This allows them to be automatically called when an object is instantiated.

No return type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. They are implicitly invoked and do not return any value explicitly.

Overloading: Constructors can be overloaded, which means a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This allows objects to be created with different initializations.

Default constructor: If a class does not define any constructors explicitly, a default constructor is automatically provided. It initializes the object with default values (zero, null, or false) or the default constructors of its member variables.

Initialization order: In object-oriented languages, constructors also help in initializing the base class before initializing the derived class.
