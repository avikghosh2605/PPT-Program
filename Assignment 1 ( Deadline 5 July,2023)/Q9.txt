Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give examples of some global attributes?



In HTML, there is a distinction between HTML tags and attributes.
An HTML tag is a markup construct that defines the beginning and end of an HTML element. It consists of the tag name enclosed in angle brackets. For example, <p> is the tag for a paragraph element.
An HTML attribute, on the other hand, provides additional information or modifies the behavior of an HTML element. Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name-value pair. They provide extra information about the element, such as its appearance, behavior, or functionality. Attributes are used to customize or configure elements.
Here are examples of some global attributes that can be used with various HTML elements:
class: Specifies one or more CSS class names to associate with an element.
id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element.
style: Defines inline CSS styles for an element.
title: Provides additional information about an element when hovering over it.
href: Specifies the URL or destination for links.
src: Specifies the source URL for external resources like images or scripts.
